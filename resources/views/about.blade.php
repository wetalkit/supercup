                       <p>We are a group of young IT and marketing professionals which came together in a WeTalkIT community in order to make positive changes in the society.  </p>  

						<p>Our city Skopje had the luck of the draw to be the host of the UEFA Super Cup 2017, our country first UEFA club competition, scheduled for August 8 in the city stadium, National Arena Filip II. Everything started so great with all of us being proud for this opportunity. Hosting a tournament in Skopje between such great teams like Real Madrid and Manchester United doesn‚Äôt happen every day.</p>

						<p>But right after the announcement, things went crazy in our country. We have many places where people can stay, but instead showing our warm hospitality, many of us started being greedy. Local hotel owners jumped on the bandwagon and <b>Skopje accommodation prices skyrocketed</b>. On regular days, one night stay in Skopje would cost you between 20 and 60 euros, and although the increase of price is normal in these circumstances, the costs went to the roof, broke it several times and now are similar to a night on the Maldives. <b>This was unacceptable for us</b>.</p>

						<p>Suddenly after the scandal, many Macedonians over the social networks offered <b>FREE accommodation</b> for the fans who got tickets for the match. <b>That‚Äôs when it clicked us, why don‚Äôt we use our IT and marketing skills to create a positive social impact?</b></p>

            <p>This was the exact moment when We Talk IT members decided to create this platform <b>offering foreign fans to find FREE place for a night or two.</b> So, if you need a place to crash, check the FAQ page or search the listings right away!</p>

		                <p><b>We hope that you will choose to stay in Skopje area and enjoy the Super Cup 2017!ü§û</b></p>
